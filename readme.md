About Me
.PP
My real name is \f[B]Aivan Ross\f[R], but I prefer \f[B]Aishen\f[R] on the internet.
My favorite programming language is \f[B]C\f[R], and I'm interested in low-level computing.
I embrace minimal technologies such as \f[B]Arch Linux\f[R], \f[B]Neovim\f[R], and other \f[B]FOSS\f[B].
.PP
Currently, I am a Computer Science student at a university in Cavite.
Outside of code, I find enjoyment in activities such as cycling and basketball, and I also enjoy playing guitar.
When it comes to music, I predominantly listen to \f[I]J-Pop\f[R] and \f[I]Kawaii Future Bass\f[R].
